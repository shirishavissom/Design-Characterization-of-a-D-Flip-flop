# Design-Characterization-of-a-D-Flip-flop
In our design process, we take on the task of designing the fundamental sequential element, namely the Flip-Flop (FF). We create a custom Flip-Flop and conduct a thorough characterization to determine its delay, input capacitance, as well as its setup and hold time.
